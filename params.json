I did this because I use\r\ndead keys often in my native language.\r\n\r\n## What are the differences between classic Dvorak and simplified Dvorak?\r\n\r\nThe differences between simplified Dvorak and classic Dvorak are limited to the numeric row and the first alphabetic row as described in the first paragraph of this article:\r\n\r\n<http://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2006-July/016530.html>\r\n\r\n## What is dvorak-classic-custom?\r\n\r\nThis custom keymap defines my personal shortcuts. It boils down to this:\r\nWhen holding down Right Alt, you get arrow keys in an inverted-T on your right hand.\r\n\r\nThe following keys:\r\n\r\n|   |   |   |   |   |\r\n|---|---|---|---|---|\r\n|g  |c  |r  |\t|   |  \t\r\n|h  |t  |n  |s  |\\  |\r\n|m  |   |v  |   |   |\t\r\n\r\nmaps to:\r\n\r\n|     |   |     |      |       |\r\n|-----|---|-----|------|-------|\r\n|home |^  |pgup | \t   |       |\t\r\n|<    |V  |>    |bcksp |return |\r\n|end  |   |pgdn |v\t   |       |\t\r\n\r\n\r\n## Configuration:\r\n\r\nThe best way to configure your layout is to use `localectl`\r\n\r\n### kbd\r\n\r\n    sudo localectl --no-convert set-keymap classic-dvorak\r\n\r\nAfter a restart this will take effect.\r\n\r\n### xkbd\r\n\r\n    sudo localectl --no-convert set-x11-keymap custom \"\" dvorak-classic-custom ctrl:swapcaps\r\n\r\n1.  Notes\r\n\r\n    -   `--no-convert` stops localectl from converting the keymap between the console and X11\r\n    -   the \"\" is where your keyboard layout would go, but I don't manually want to configure that, so I leave it blank.\r\n    -   `dvorak-classic-custom` is my default layout in this keymap\r\n    -   I swap ctrl and capslock using `ctrl:swapcaps`\r\n\r\n### Switching between profiles in X11\r\n\r\nTo switch between normal qwerty and my layout you must add the `us` keymap in `localectl`:\r\n\r\n    localectl --no-convert set-x11-keymap custom,us \"\" dvorak-classic-custom ctrl:swapcaps\r\n\r\nTo switch to layout `custom( dvorak-classic-custom)` use:\r\n\r\n    setxkbmap -layout custom\\(dvorak-classic-custom\\)\r\n\r\nTo switch to `us(intl)`:\r\n\r\n    setxkbmap -layout us\\(intl\\)\r\n",
